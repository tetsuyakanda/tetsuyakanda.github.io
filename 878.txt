In software evolution, branching of development occurs in some cases.
If a developer wants to select a source file to which the latest bug fixes
was performed or to collect functions out of branched software,
it is important to know the derivative relationships of source files.
In this paper, we focus on the differences of similar files and propose
an approach for automatic extraction of the derivative relationships of source files.
We construct a minimum spanning tree based on the number of lines of difference.
The tree minimizes the amount of difference developers read.
We performed a case study with open source software and discussed
for the future work.
