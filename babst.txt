It is important for both users and developers to select an application what they need from similar applications.
For users, it is one hint to know the differences of between applications with similar functions when selecting an application to use.
Also for developers who want to add functions to an existing application, it is important to understand differences of functions implemented in applications.
Therefore, clarifying differences between applications is needed.
There are some ways to compare functions in several similar applications (e.g., using the applications, reading documents, and comparing source code).
However, these methods for comparing have some problems.
For example, the methods require a lot of effort of users, and it is difficult for users to set criteria for comparison.
Therefore, it is hard to compare applications in easily understood form by these methods.
In this paper, I propose a novel method of clarifying functional differences between applications by focusing on differences in API calling sequences.
Generally, developers implement a function by combining APIs provided by the platform them.
Therefore, I made a hypothesis that an API Calling sequence represents a function of an application. 
I made a prototype tool to extract API callings from source code of Android applications and compare the sequences of API callings.
I performed a case study to evaluate the validity of the method with the prototype tool.
The evaluation selected Android, platform for mobile devices, as a target of study.
The result of a case study shows that comparing applications in terms of functions can be achieved by the proposed method.
