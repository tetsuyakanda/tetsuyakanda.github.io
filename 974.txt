This paper proposes a method to estimate a product evolution
graph based on Kolmogorov Complexity. The method applies lossless
compression to source code of products, then, presumes derivation
relations between two products when information increment between
the two products is minimum. An evaluation experiment confirms that
proposed method and existing method PRET have different tendency
of errors in estimation results.
