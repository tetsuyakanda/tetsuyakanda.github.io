Source code is often reused in software development. Such reuse activity may result in a large number
of similar software products. To understand commonalities and variabilities among such similar products,
comparison of their source code is important. However, each product may change its own directory struc-
ture; it is hard to identify corresponding directories among products. In this paper, we propose a technique
to extract and visualize a unied directory tree. The extracted directory tree includes all the directories of
given products and merges corresponding directories into a single node. Since a node in a tree corresponds
to multiple directories in products, developers can easily compare the contents of les. As a case study of
our protoype, we conducted a case study with four Android products.
